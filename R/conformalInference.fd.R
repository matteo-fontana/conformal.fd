#' Tools for conformal inference in regression in functional setting
#'
#' A collection of tools for distribution-free inference for regression problems
#' in functional setting using the theory of conformal prediction.
#'
#' @details Conformal inference is a framework for converting any pre-chosen estimator of
#'   the regression function into prediction regions with finite-sample
#'   validity, under essentially no assumptions on the data-generating process
#'   (aside from the the assumption of i.i.d. observations). The main functions
#'   in this package for computing such prediction regions are \code{\link{conformal.fun.split}} , i.e. a single split, and \code{\link{conformal.fun.msplit}} , i.e. joining B splits.
#' @references The function structure is taken from "Conformal Prediction Bands
#' for Multivariate Functional Data" by Diquigiovanni, Fontana, Vantini (2021) and,
#' also, from "The Importance of Being a Band: Finite-Sample Exact Distribution-Free
#' Prediction Sets for Functional Data" by Diquigiovanni, Fontana, Vantini (2021).
